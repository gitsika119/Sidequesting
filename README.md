# Sidequesting 
An app I made for my boyfriend because he starts too many shows and doesn't remember to finish them :)
## Summary 
The application consists of 3 pages - The Home page goes to DNF page and Completed page. All pages can be accessed from another page at anytime.
The DNF page won't let you enter more then 5 tasts at a time andhas the following functionalities:
<ul>
  Double click to mark task as Completed (shows on completed page)
  Click to edit task 
  Enter to get new text box (<5 tasks) or a Cynthia sprite saying no (page has 5 tasks)
</ul>
The completed page has everything double clicked from the DNF page and to trash tasks forever just click on them.
