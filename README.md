# Sidequesting 
An app I made for my boyfriend because he starts too many books and doesn't remember to finish them :)
## Summary 
The application consists of 3 pages - The Home page, DNF (Didn't finish) page and Completed page. All pages can be accessed from another page at anytime.
The DNF page won't let you enter more then 5 tasts at a time andhas the following functionalities:

<ul>
  <li>Double click to mark task as Completed (shows on completed page)</li>
  <li>Click to edit task </li>
  <li>Enter to get new text box (<5 tasks) or a Cynthia sprite saying no (page has 5 tasks)</li>
</ul>
    
The completed page has everything double clicked from the DNF page and to trash tasks forever just click on them.
## How to use
Download zip and then run index.html to run in browser, ideally in a 1080x1080 window.
